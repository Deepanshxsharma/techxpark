## 🔒 Security

- All booking operations use **Firestore transactions** to prevent race conditions and double bookings.
- **Abuse monitoring** tracks failed booking attempts and blocks suspicious activity.
- Firestore Security Rules enforce role-based access control (`customer`, `owner`, `admin`).
- Sensitive files (`google-services.json`, keystores, `.env`) are excluded via `.gitignore`.
